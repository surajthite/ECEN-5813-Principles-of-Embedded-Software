# INSTALLATION AND EXECUTION NOTES 
  

 The code is tested on the enviornment below: 
 
 1. MCUXpresso IDE which is an easy to use Eclipse-based development environment for NXP® MCUs based on Arm® Cortex®-M cores. Fb_debug and fb_run modules were compiled and executed on this IDE.
 
 2. MCUXpresso IDE which is an easy to use Eclipse-based development environment for NXP® MCUs based on Arm® Cortex®-M cores. Fb_debug and fb_run modules were compiled and executed on this IDE.
 
 3.	The MakeFile for the code of the whole project was developed and built on MCUXpresso IDE with all build options and flags mandatory to execute and build the project.
 
 4.	The hardware used in this project was FRDM-KL25Z board which  has been designed by NXP and built  on ARM® Cortex™-M0+ processor. 
 
 5. The editor used to build the code is gedit version 2.3.8.1 on Linux Mint Machine.
 
 6. To execute the executable file simply type ./(filename) in linux gcc environment while click on debug (bug icon) and then resume button to execute the file on MCUXpresso.
 
 7. To compile and create executable file in linux environment , type gcc (filename).c -o (filename) -Wall - Werror -lm
 
 8. Kindly use notepad++ for viewing .out files ,particularly for first output since they have been misaligned due to character "Space or Tab" encoding.
